# 🌟 My Frontend Development Journey  
**Mentors / Trainers :** Sahil Kumar & Deepak Prasad  

This training helped me understand how websites are actually made from building the structure with *HTML*, styling it with *CSS*, and finally making everything look good and work smoothly on all screens using *Bootstrap*.  
Throughout the sessions, I learned how to create clean, responsive, and interactive web pages that adjust perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  

## 📖 Overview :

The goal of this training was to learn the basics of web development starting from *HTML (structure)*, then *CSS (design)*, and finally *Bootstrap (responsiveness)*.
